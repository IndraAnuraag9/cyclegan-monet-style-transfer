## Overview

This repository contains the code, methodology, and final report for our project  
**“Impressionist Imagery with CycleGAN: Unpaired Image Translation for Monet-Style Generation,”**  
completed for **GMU CS 747 — Deep Learning - Fall 2024**.

The goal of the project is to generate **Monet-inspired Impressionist images** from real photographs using **CycleGAN**, trained on unpaired datasets of Monet paintings and natural images.

This repository serves as a **research archive**: the complete code and report are preserved, while trained weights and large-scale outputs are not included due to compute constraints.

## Method Summary

We implemented and iteratively improved a CycleGAN-based system for artistic style transfer.  
Three primary versions were built:

### **V1 — Baseline CycleGAN**
- Standard architecture  
- Frequent mode collapse and unstable training  

### **V2 — Stability Enhancements**
- Color consistency loss  
- Learning rate and batch size tuning  

### **V3 — Final Model**
- Style loss using VGG features  
- Residual blocks with grouped convolutions  
- Histogram equalization  
- Significantly improved texture and stylistic fidelity  
- Achieved **MiFID: 73.59**

## Reproducibility Notes

- Trained model weights **are not available**  
- ≈7000 generated images for Kaggle submission are **not included**  
- Final training and inference were performed on **university cluster + Kaggle GPU**  
- This repository documents the methodology and code rather than a fully runnable pipeline
